      <description>a surface wave or wrinkle.   -- Summary Most biological materials (and industrial) are reinforced with stiff fibres or are under tension. I figure out how these mechanisms influence elastic surface waves and the formation of surface wrinkles. The main reasons to do this are
 will give us greater control over surface waves or forming textured surfaces (using surface wrinkles). use these surface waves and surface wrinkles to measure biological materials.</description>

      <title>The constitutive relations of initially stressed incompressible Mooney-Rivlin materials</title>
      <link>https://arturgower.github.io/publication/initial-mooney/</link>

      <description>   Illustrates how the virtual stress-free state relates to a formulation purely in terms of stress tensors. B0 is virtual stress-free state, B1 is the initially stressed configuration with internal stress τ, and B2 is the current configuration with Cauchy stress σ.   </description>

      <title>A new restriction for initially stressed elastic solids</title>

      <description>    This is from an example that illustrates that even uniaxial deformations lead to unphysical results, if our restriction is not satisfied.   </description>

      <description>   The wrinkles do not always align in the direction of greatest stress or aligned with the fibres.   </description>

      <title>Morphology of residually stressed tubular tissues: Beyond the elastic multiplicative decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arturgower.github.io/publication/tube-morphology/</link>

      <guid>https://arturgower.github.io/publication/tube-morphology/</guid>
      <description>   Illustrates the kind of wrinkling instabilities that appear for different distributions of residual stress. These studies can help explain the morphology of tubular structures. For a growing tissue, like our intestine, to form a specific type of wrinkle, it need only generate the right kind of stress, then the tube will spontaneously wrinkle.   </description>

      <title>On residual stresses and homeostasis: an elastic theory of functional adaptation in living matter</title>

      <description>   Illustrates a Wapa tree that explodes when cut, because it is releasing a tremendous amount of residual stress.   </description>

      <title>Nonlinear Elastodynamics with Radial Symmetry (Elasticidade nao linear com simetria radial)</title>

      <description>Summary The image above shows the story of a wave propagating in a sphere, like a planet, travelling through both time t and space R (distance from origin).
The wave is an elastic wave with radial symmetry, so we can imagine this as a wave created from the centre of the earth. The colour indicates the amplitude of the wave, with yellow-ish corresponding to no wave. In this image the wave begins at 1km from the centre of the earth, R=1, at time t=0.</description>

      <title>The mechanics of soft solids</title>
      <link>https://arturgower.github.io/project/initial-stress/</link>

      <description>Most of my work on elastic solids has been on constitutive equations, that is, mathematically describing the different components of a solid, and how these effect the forces and deformations. With the two main themes being stressed solids and fibre-reinforced solids. I have also explored how to use waves and instabilities to characterise solids.
Initially stressed solids The driving question is how to mathematically describe the mechanical response of residually stressed solids?</description>
