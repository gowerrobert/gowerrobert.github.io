      <description>To the right of the dashed line are particles, whose position has been numerically ensemble averaged. To the left is just a homogenious medium. What is shown here (though faintly) is that more than one transmitted wave exists in an ensemble averaged medium. The paper shows this with much more clarity!</description>

      <description>placing impenetrable particles side-by-side creates the same effect as a solid wall. In this case I left two gaps in the wall, so that as this wave squeezes through two gaps, it interacts with itself, creating a unique diffraction pattern on the right. This figure is a snapshot of this wave for a fixed time.        Similar to the figure above, here we show the absolute magnitude of the wave.</description>
