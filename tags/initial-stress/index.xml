      <description>Most of my work on elastic solids has been on constitutive equations, that is, mathematically describing the different components of a solid, and how these effect the forces and deformations. With the two main themes being stressed solids and fibre-reinforced solids. I have also explored how to use waves and instabilities to characterise solids.
Initially stressed solids The driving question is how to mathematically describe the mechanical response of residually stressed solids?</description>
