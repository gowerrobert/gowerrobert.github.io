      <description>Summary When we compress a soft solid enough, it will form wrinkles on its surface, as shown by the figure below.   When a soft solid is sheared enough, it will form wrinkles on its surface. The black lines show the directions of reinforcing fibres.   Most biological materials (and industrial) are reinforced with stiff fibres. Knowing how these wrinkles form
 will give us greater control when creating textured surfaces.</description>

      <title>Shear instability in skin tissue</title>

      <description>On the left the skin at rest, on the right we shear the skin until wrinkles form. What can these wrinkles tell us about the skin?   We explore how the alignment of surface wrinkles relate to the directions of the reinforcing fibres in the skin. This technique is used to estimate the Langer lines (directions of greatest tension), which then indicates where incisions are best made for surgery.</description>
