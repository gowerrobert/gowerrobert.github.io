      <description>I write software to efficiently calculate wave scattering between particles, and to calculate effective waves from homogenisation methods.</description>

      <description>a surface wave or wrinkle.   -- Summary Most biological materials (and industrial) are reinforced with stiff fibres or are under tension. I figure out how these mechanisms influence elastic surface waves and the formation of surface wrinkles. The main reasons to do this are
 will give us greater control over surface waves or forming textured surfaces (using surface wrinkles). use these surface waves and surface wrinkles to measure biological materials.</description>

      <description>I am currently working on multiply scattering in random media. See example video below! I develop methods to calculate the ensemble average of the wave, which I compare with numerical benchmarks based on the multipole method.

      <title>Nonlinear Elastodynamics with Radial Symmetry (Elasticidade nao linear com simetria radial)</title>

      <description>Summary The image above shows the story of a wave propagating in a sphere, like a planet, travelling through both time t and space R (distance from origin).
The wave is an elastic wave with radial symmetry, so we can imagine this as a wave created from the centre of the earth. The colour indicates the amplitude of the wave, with yellow-ish corresponding to no wave. In this image the wave begins at 1km from the centre of the earth, R=1, at time t=0.</description>
