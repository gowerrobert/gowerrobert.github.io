The prerequisite for the course is 

=> linear algebra: singular value decomposition, positive (semi) definite matrices, vector norms, matrix norms
=> vector calculus: gradient, multivariate chain rule, Jacobians, Hessian matrices
=> probability: Discrete distributions, random variables, expectation, conditional expectation, convergence in L2

Some books that cover these pre-requisites are
